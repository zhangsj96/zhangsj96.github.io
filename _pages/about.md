Hello! My name is Shangjia Zhang (张尚嘉). I recently graduated from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV) and will be a NHFP (NASA Hubble Fellowship Program) Sagan Fellow at Columbia University hosted by [Prof. Jane Huang](http://janehuang.astro.columbia.edu/). For my PhD, I worked with [Prof. Zhaohuan Zhu](https://unlv-spfg.github.io/team/zhu-zhaohuan/) on various aspects of the protoplanetary disk, the birthplace of planets. Before coming to Las Vegas, I was an undergraduate at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. I studied star formation with [Prof. Lee Hartmann](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/lhartm/) back then.

Now I study protoplanetary disks with self-consistent disk thermodynamics, including shadowing and planet-disk interactions. This can be realized by the powerful Athena++ radiation module developed by [Dr. Yan-Fei Jiang](https://jiangyanfei1986.wixsite.com/yanfei-homepage).

You can find my publications on ADS [here](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/public-libraries/Pr-dNlzISAu-ZARtksGGqQ).
