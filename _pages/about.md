Hello! My name is Shangjia Zhang (张尚嘉). I am a fifth-year graduate student studying Astronomy at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV). I work with [Prof. Zhaohuan Zhu](https://unlv-spfg.github.io/team/zhu-zhaohuan/) on various aspects of the protoplanetary disk, the birthplace of planets. Before coming to Las Vegas, I was an undergraduate at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. I studied star formation with [Prof. Lee Hartmann](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/lhartm/) back then.

Now I am building a 3D radiation hydrodynamics planet-disk interaction simulation. This can be realized by the powerful Athena++ radiation module developed by [Dr. Yan-Fei Jiang](https://jiangyanfei1986.wixsite.com/yanfei-homepage). I am implementing the stellar irradiation with mesh refinement and MPI. Once the radiation is coupled with the hydrodynamics, we hope to explain more interesting observations (for example, shadowing in protoplanetary disks).

You can find my publications on ADS [here](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/public-libraries/Pr-dNlzISAu-ZARtksGGqQ).
