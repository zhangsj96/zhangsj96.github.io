Hello! My name is Shangjia Zhang (张尚嘉). I am an NHFP (NASA Hubble Fellowship Program) Sagan Fellow at Columbia University, hosted by [Prof. Jane Huang](http://janehuang.astro.columbia.edu/). I recently graduated from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV), where I worked with [Prof. Zhaohuan Zhu](https://unlv-spfg.github.io/team/zhu-zhaohuan/) on various aspects of the protoplanetary disk, the birthplace of planets. Prior to Las Vegas, I completed my undergraduate studies at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, where I worked with [Prof. Lee Hartmann](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/lhartm/) on star formation. Before that, I spent two years at Nanjing University, which has one of the most prestigious astronomy programs in China. I was born and raised in Beijing, China.

Currently, I study protoplanetary disks with a focus on self-consistent disk thermodynamics, including shadowing, planet-disk interactions, and vertical shear instability (VSI). I use the powerful Athena++ radiation module developed by [Dr. Yan-Fei Jiang](https://jiangyanfei1986.wixsite.com/yanfei-homepage) to carry out my research. The goal is to empower the interpretation of the increasingly detailed data from fast-advancing ALMA (Atacama Large Millimeter Array) and exAO (extreme Adaptive Optics) observations.

Since dust particles provide both the mass for planets and opacity for radiation, I am also interested in constraining dust particle size and porosity in protoplanetary disks using continuum and polarization observations.

Additionally, I am keen on inferring planet populations from ALMA surveys such as DSHARP and the Taurus sample, using fittings—including machine learning techniques—based on suites of planet-disk interaction simulations.

You can find my publications on ADS [here](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/public-libraries/Pr-dNlzISAu-ZARtksGGqQ).
