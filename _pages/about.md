Hello! My name is Shangjia Zhang (张尚嘉). I am a fifth-year graduate student studying Astronomy at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV). I am working with [Prof. Zhaohuan Zhu](https://unlv-spfg.github.io/team/zhu-zhaohuan/) on various aspects of the protoplanetary disk, the birthplace of planets. Before coming to Las Vegas, I was an undergraduate at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. I studied star formation with Prof. Lee Hartmann back then.

My current thesis project is to build a 3D radiation hydrodynamics planet-disk interaction simulation. This can be realized by the powerful Athena++ radiation module. I am working with [Dr. Yan-Fei Jiang](https://jiangyanfei1986.wixsite.com/yanfei-homepage) on implementing stellar irradiation with mesh refinement and MPI. Once the radiation is coupled with the hydrodynamics, we expect the disk to behave differently. We can better explain many fantastic observations (for example, shadowing in protoplanetary disks).

Before setting up a planet for our radiation-hydro simulations, we use the code to study vertical shear instability (VSI). The turbulence can be stronger due to the vertical temperature structure set by the stellar irradiation than the vertically isothermal setups. The previously predicted corrugation mode is also hard to identify. Consequently, we need to make more detailed predictions for ALMA observations.

On the observational side, I work with [Prof. Akimasa Kataoka](https://sci.nao.ac.jp/MEMBER/kataoka/index_en.html) and [Dr. Takahiro Ueda](https://www.takahiroueda.net/) to constrain the dust size and porosity in protoplanetary disks. Porous dust aggregates are prevalent products in laboratory experiments of dust growth and are commonly found in our solar system (for example, on the comet 67P by the Rosetta mission). We use ALMA and VLA continuum and dust polarization observations to study the HL Tau disk. The mm-cm-sized porous grains with ~70% porosity can perfectly explain these observations. The porosity level is very consistent with those measurements in our solar system.

I am also interested in using planet-disk interactions to explain the potential young planet population in the ALMA [DSHARP](https://almascience.eso.org/almadata/lp/DSHARP/) and Taurus surveys. Using deep learning techniques, we can rapidly infer the planet mass from a disk image. With the influx of high-resolution ALMA images, we are beginning to make a connection with mature planet populations detected by existing exoplanet detection methods such as direct imaging and microlensing.

Working in a small research group does not necessarily mean less opportunities. I was awarded [UNLV Barrick Fellowship](https://unlv-spfg.github.io/awards/barrick/) from 2020-2021 and [NASA FINNEST Grant](https://unlv-spfg.github.io/awards/finnest/) from 2021-2024. I was fortunate to be the first student at UNLV to get the FINNEST grant and the first student in the College of Sciences to get the UNLV Graduate Fellowship. I am very happy to help current applicants and share my application materials, especially for those from a small institute with scarce resources like us at UNLV.
